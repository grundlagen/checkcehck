# Project Overview

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for embedding extraction and other experiments.

## Environment Variables

To use the DeepSeek API within `deepseek2.py`, you must set the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable in your deployment environment. Example:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Ensure this variable is configured before running any scripts that depend on DeepSeek.
