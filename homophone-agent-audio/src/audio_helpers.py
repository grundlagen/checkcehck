audio_helpers.py
-----------------

This module defines a tiny abstraction layer for text‑to‑speech (TTS) and
automatic speech recognition (ASR) used to evaluate the "heard‑as"
similarity between candidate homophonic translations and the source
phrase. The functions provided here are mere stubs: they do not
implement any real synthesis or recognition functionality by default.
Instead they are designed to be easily replaced or monkey‑patched by
clients who have access to the requisite APIs or local models.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

* ``synthesize_audio(text: str, format: str = "opus") -> bytes``
    Given a text string, return audio data encoded in the requested
    format. The default format is ``opus`` for compactness. In this
    reference implementation, the function returns an empty byte string.

* ``speech_to_text(audio: bytes, lang: str) -> str``
    Given audio data (presumably returned from ``synthesize_audio``)
    produce a transcript of what a speech recognizer "hears". The
    default implementation always returns the empty string.

* ``heard_as_bonus(src_text: str, src_ipa: str, candidate_text: str,
    candidate_ipa: str, phone_dist: Any) -> float``
    A convenience wrapper that attempts to synthesize ``candidate_text``
    into audio, transcribe it back, and compare the resulting transcript
    against the source text/IPA. If the transcript is sufficiently
    similar to the source, it returns a small positive bonus that can
    be added to the overall score (e.g. 0.05). Otherwise it returns
    zero. This function never raises; failures simply yield no bonus.

Clients integrating real TTS/ASR backends should override
``synthesize_audio`` and ``speech_to_text`` to perform the desired
operations. For example, one could call OpenAI's Text‑to‑Speech API
and Whisper or another ASR service. The wrapper will then produce
meaningful bonuses for phonetically convincing candidates.

    """
    Attempt to assess whether an ASR would "hear" the candidate as
    sufficiently close to the source. If so, return ``bonus``, else zero.

    This function first calls ``synthesize_audio`` on the candidate text.
    It then calls ``speech_to_text`` on the result to obtain what a
    recognizer hears. Two checks are performed:

    1. Normalized Levenshtein similarity between the source text and the
       ASR transcript must exceed 0.6.
    2. If an IPA string for the source is provided, the phonetic
       similarity between the ASR transcript (converted to IPA via
       g2p outside this module) and the source IPA must exceed 0.5.

    If both conditions hold (or if the IPA is missing and the first
    condition holds), the bonus is returned. Otherwise zero is returned.

    The thresholds are intentionally conservative; feel free to tune
    them for your application. Errors in synthesis or recognition will
    be logged but will not raise exceptions.
